# CS747
Assignments of the course CS747: Foundations of Intelligent and Learning Agents.
I have used Python 3.8.10 for my assignments and you can install the same from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3810/) \
Each assignment has some prebuilt libraries(mentioned in requirements.txt) needed for it to run, install them by running 
```
& pip install -r requirements.txt

```
